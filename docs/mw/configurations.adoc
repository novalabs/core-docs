== Configurations
`core::mw::CoreConfiguration` class implements a kind-of reflection system, which allows to access derived class members by their name:

[source,cpp,numbered]
----
core::led::LedPublisherConfiguration configuration;

configuration.led = 5;
----

is the same as

[source,cpp,numbered]
----
core::led::LedPublisherConfiguration configuration;

configuration["led"] = 5;
----

This is useful for a runtime configuration of the node.

TIP: Even though it is possible to directly write the configuration code, it is better to use the facilities provided by link:../core/index.html#coreconfiguration-reference[Core Configuration].

[WARNING]
====
As this system relies on type deduction for template argument and return value types, special care must be used in assignments using the `[]` operator.
This is specially true in assignments of numeric literals.

It is better to always force the type by using an explicit cast or the user defined literals `_s8`, `_u8`, `_s16`, `_u16`, `_s32`, `_u32`, `_s64`, `_u64`, `_f32`, `_f64`.

[source,cpp,numbered]
----
core::led::LedPublisherConfiguration configuration;

configuration["led"] = (uint32_t)5; <1>
configuration["led"] = 5_u32; <2>
----
<1> explicit cast
<2> user defined literal
