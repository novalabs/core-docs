== Messages
A message is the datatype of a topic, that is the data that nodes can share by means of the publish/subscribe middleware.

From the source code point of view a message is a subclass of `core::mw::Message`.

WARNING: The subclass must be defined as a packed struct using the `CORE_PACKED` macro.

.A message derived from `core::mw::Message`
=================
[source,cpp,numbered]
----
#pragma once

#include <core/mw/Message.hpp>

struct example:
	  public core::mw::Message <1>
{
	  uint32_t value;
} CORE_PACKED; <2>
----
<1> extend `core::mw::Message`
<2> make it a packed struct
=================

TIP: Even though it is possible to directly write the message code, it is better to use the facilities provided by link:../core/index.html#coremessage-reference[Core Message].
