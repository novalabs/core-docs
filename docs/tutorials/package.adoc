[[corepackage-overview]]
=== Overview
A Core package is a bundle of reusable code and meta-data.

A package can include:

* message definitions
* node definitions
* node source code
* node configuration definitions
* ... other code

Packages are processed by the link:../tools/index.html#coretools-corepackage[CorePackage.py] and link:../tools/index.html#coretools-coreworkspace[CoreWorkspace.py] command line tool.

From a Core user point of view a package is nothing but a directory that meets the following requirements:

. it contains a file named `CORE_PACKAGE.json`
. it contains a license file `LICENSE` 
. it have a well defined structure

[[corepackage-json]]
=== CORE_PACKAGE.json
The `CORE_PACKAGE.json` file describes the package, and it is used by the Core build system either to manage the dependencies or to generate the makefiles.

The file must be valid according to an Apache Avro footnoteref:[AVRO] schema.

.Example: `CORE_PACKAGE.json` file for `led` package
[source,json,numbered]
----
{
  "name": "led", <1>
  "description": "LED Nodes", <2>
  "namespace": "@", <3>
  "sources": [ <4>
    "PublisherNode.cpp",
    "SubscriberNode.cpp"
   ]
}
----
<1> the `name` of the message field must match the name of the package directory
<2> a brief description
<3> by default ('@') the namespace will be the name of the package; `namespace` can be used to override it
<4> list of source files that will be compiled and linked with the target

[[corepackage-structure]]
=== Package directory structure
There are two kinds of packages, depending on their content: messages or non-messages.

It is surely possible to have messages in a non-messages package, but this is strongly discouraged.

==== Messages packages
Message packages must contain nothing but message definition files.

These files must be inside a directory called `messages`.

NOTE: It is customary that message packages name ends with `_msgs`.

.`led_msgs` Package
[plantuml,led_msgs-package-tree,"{plantuml_format}"]
----
salt
{{T
+ led_msgs
++ CORE_PACKAGE.json
++ LICENSE
++ messages
+++ Led.json
}}
----

==== Non-Messages packages
Non-Messages package must not contain any message definition files.

Source code must be put inside the `include` and `src` directories. +
Nodes definitions must reside in `nodes` directory, while node configuration definitions must be in `configurations`.

.`led` Package
[plantuml,led-package-tree,"{plantuml_format}"]
